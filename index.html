            Hi.  My name is Karl John Greggan, I was born in Manchester (a long time ago), and still live in my home city.
        </p>
        <a id="Background">
        </a>  
        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>
            After a brief stint in the Royal Air Force, I started my long career in the banking and finance industry.
        </p><p>
            My first banking job was with the Halifax Building Society (later to become HBoS, then Lloyds Banking Group) in Manchester, initially working in a branch serving customers that included some Coronation Street actors.  Eventually I moved onto the head office building in Halifax, where I specialised in business analysis, and eventually software testing.
        </p><p>
            For the past 10 years I have been contracting as a test analyst, and have had the opportunity to work in other countries (Ireland and India), and to work with some of the biggest global companies (Apple, Google, Visa, HSBC).
        </p>

        <h2>Why I was interested in joining...</h2>

        <p>
            As software testing moves increasingly towards an automated framework and toolset, my currently manual testing skill set is becoming less in demand.  Therefore, in order to embrace the new technology being introduced and used in the software testing industry, I have started to undergo some self development in order to gain the knowledge and skills required.  The first step of my development journey has brought me to CodeNation, where I am looking to get an introduction to coding, and other modern project tools such as GITHUB, VS Code, Slack and Trello.  To date I have really enjoyed my time at CodeNation, and have definitely gained some new knowledge. 
        </p><p>
            The journey continues……
